# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a simple, interactive web-based application that visually demonstrates how common sorting algorithms work. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the Sorting Visualizer allows users to generate a random array and observe how different algorithms sort the elements step by step.

## Overview

Understanding how sorting algorithms work can be challenging when studied through static diagrams or textbook explanations. This visualizer is designed to bridge that gap by providing a real-time, animated representation of how sorting algorithms operate on data.

## Features

- Generates a new array of random values each time the user clicks the "Generate New Array" button
- Visualizes the sorting process using vertical bars with dynamic height
- Allows selection of different sorting algorithms, including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Animates comparisons and swaps during sorting to clearly illustrate the logic of each algorithm
- Ensures a clean user interface with responsive interaction and disabled buttons during sorting

## Technologies Used

- HTML for structuring the web page
- CSS for styling the interface and animations
- JavaScript for implementing the sorting logic and DOM manipulation
